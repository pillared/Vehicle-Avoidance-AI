### Predictive analytics for vehicle collisions through the use of a multivariate linear regression neural network

***
**Objective**
	
> Predict vehicle collision with objects based on a spherical earth and constant speeds using a multi-variable linear regression neural network
	
****
**Contents:**

> Report.pdf - IEEE standard report explaining research and findings

> PRESENTATION.pdf - Powerpoint that explains each of the following scripts

> AI.py - Script to generate dataset containing input needed to feed neural network
	        
> vehicle\_collision\_data.csv - CSV file containing data generated from AI.py
			
> KRNN.py - Script for Neural Network implementation using Keras 
			
****
**Directions:**

>Download Vehicle-Avoidance-AI and 

>either run KRNN.py to run the Neural Network with the current dataset given, or 

>run AI.py to generate a similar dataset and then run with KRNN.py
